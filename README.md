# BlenderGameDevAddon (Free scripts)
A Blender addon devised to assist in the production of game development

This addon consist of multiple tools developed to streamline the game developement process. 
Some of the tools are adapted/ modified versions of excisting tools from public GNU license repositories


# Update
For early addopters who have noticed the now missing scripts these have now been retracted and will soon be available on Blender marketplace, I hope you are understanding that doing this will allow me to support the development and refinement of these and new tools in the future 

# Mesh Tools

- Quick suffix 
  - for quickly assigning predefined suffixes to any mesh

- Pivot painter
  - record indevidual mesh pivot positions to either texture or vertex color


- vertex animation
  - convert blend shape animation to a texture to be used within engine to recreate mesh deformation at realtime 


- Tex plane tesselation 
  - cut out alpha cards for foliage or any kind of asset witha single click
