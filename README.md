# BlenderGameDevAddon
A Blender addon devised to assist in the production of game development and multiple task

This addon consist of multiple tools developed to streamline the game developement process 
some of the tools are adapted/ modified versions of excisting tools form GNU liscens repositories


# Mesh Tools

- Quick suffix 
  - for quickly assigning predefined suffixes to any mesh


- Batch library importer
  - batch import meshes into the blender asset library


- Generate Moss cap
  - generates a cap mesh to work with a predifined shader to create a coat of moss cards


- Pivot painter
  - record indevidual mesh pivot positions to either texture or vertex color


- vertex animation
  - convert blend shape animation to a texture to be used within engine to recreate mesh deformation at realtime 


- Tex plane tesselation 
  - cut out alpha cards for foliage or any kind of asset witha single click 


- Load PBR Mat
  - instantly import any texture set into blender for realtime preview (WIP UX)

- Custom export 
  - export selected mesh and children objects at world center and apply SM_ prefix (WIP UX)

- Custom col
  - quickly assign custom collision meshes to selection (WIP UX)

# UV Tools

- Color Atlas Tools
  - quickly shift selection UV into apporpriate UV space on atlas texture
  - quickly move selected UV islands into the correct Udim space for Virtual texture atlases

- Texel Density
